## Environment

You should have a `.env.local` with the following:

- DATO_CMS_TOKEN
- PREVIEW_MODE_SECRET
- NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MODE
- NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_CODE
- NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_EVENT_CATEGORY

## Extra steps

- Please remember to update the project name and version (reset back to 1.0.0) in the `package.json` before your initial commit.
- Check and update the CODEOWNERS file, ensuring that the primary project developers are correctly listed.
- Once the Dato instance is set up and content is being modelled, considering uncommenting the relative lines in the `data` layers directory and replacing the temporary data with CMS data.
